        <h1> History of Tyrdrall thus far</h1>

        <p>The word of Tyrdrall has an extensive history of strife and ruin.</p>

        <h3> The Harrowing</h3>
        <p>
            A time where humanity as a whole was very prosperous and was too arrogant in their ways. A mortal ascended to
            godhood, replacing the god of death who was forgotten to history. Due to this, the rest of the gods felt as
            though humanities power was too far evolved and thusly began the the great harrowing. </p>

        <p>
            The Gods themselves came down to what is now know as Tydrall. The very land splitting into multiple
            continents and smaller island chain land masses. The Faded Lands being one of the sets of land masses in
            question. The raw unbridled wrath of the gods themselves was enough to tear the lands themselves apart and
            almost wiped out all of humanity and leaving the other races even more scattered than they already were.</p>

        <p>The Harrowing left the world and it's people sundered, and the gods felt a need to keep a closer eye on
            mortals, and arcane magic is not looked upon as favorably in a lot of circles at the current time. The
            Graythorns of The Faded Lands are a prominent figure in the arcane arts and are looked upon rather
            wearily as they use necromantic magics to run their trade empire. </p>
